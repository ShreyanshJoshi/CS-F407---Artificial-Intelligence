## Local Search Algorithms
This folder contains my code in Python for a project that was done in partial fulfillment of the course **CS F407 - Artificial Intelligence (AI)** at BITS Pilani for the year 2020-21.

The project had 2 questions that we had to implement using a local search algorithm (**genetic algorithm**). 
* Question 1 - We had to implement the renowned *8-queens problem*. The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens
share the same row, column, or diagonal.

* Question 2 - Here, we had to implement another famous problem - *Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)*, which is in fact an NP-Hard problem (meaning no polynomial time solution exists
for it yet. In this problem, given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, we have to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns
to the origin city. TSP is one of the most famous and intensively studied problems in the field of theoretical computer science.

Both these questions had to be solved using genetic algorithm, wherein we were supposed to initially implement a basic version and later optimize it as much as possible with 
tweaks and tricks to minimize the running time (in terms of iterations). All approaches that were tried out in doing so had to be formulated into a report that had to be submitted.
Everything I tried has been written in the report that I have uploaded.

### How to run code on your machine -
To run the game locally, clone the repository and download the source code present in this folder. Store it in a designated directory (folder) on your local machine. Then simply
run that python file, and it will prompt the user for an input, depending on which the program for question 1 or 2 is executed.
